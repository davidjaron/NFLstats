### CS5200 Group Project, NFL stats

This project allows a user to search for a players and view their stats for the 2017 season (for their specific position). It also allows for 5+ different user types, with different privileges for each type of user. For example: users are able to create watchlists for example, which means they can follow a group of players to quickly see updates to their statistics. Users can also leave comments on players pages and reply to comments to discuss the player with each other. 

The project uses a SQL database created using JPA as the backend, with mappings done in java using Springboot. The front end is done in Angular.
